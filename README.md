# metabolizer

Here you can find the R script of the Metabolizer tool and some toy examples of its usage. 
In addition to this R code, you can also perform the analysis of the metabolic module activity using the Metabolizer webserver at: http://metabolizer.babelomics.org/

We will be adding more species to our tool. You will be able to follow or find the upcoming updates in this github repository.
